# About
- Linkedin currently only allows the download of our CV in a single language. This solution allows you to save the html of the page and paste it, transforming your profile into a json.
- I managed to implement this solution in C#, but I switched to javascript, precisely to meet the main objective, being a web solution

# Participate in ideas and improvements developments
Improvements to be added in the future: 
 - Transform json into a custom Word, PDF file
 -
